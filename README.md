## Abstract

What do accreting black holes look like? Ray-tracing methods are ubiquitous in
modern computer graphics, but are also used in many astrophysical problems --
predominantly for integrating the radiative transfer equations or calculating
photon polarization. General relativistic ray-tracing (GRRT) is the extension
of the technique to curved space, and has become an essential tool in the black
hole simulator's toolbox. In GRRT, light no longer travels in straight lines,
and therefore manifestly includes the gravitational lensing distortions
predicted by Einstein's theories. GRRT can be used to calculate the appearance
of accreting objects, including the energetic distortions needed to determine
emission spectra, allowing us to simulate observations of these systems and
imagine the unresolvable. In this talk I will overview the GRRT technique for
modelling active galactic nuclei and black hole X-ray binaries. I will explain
how GRRT can be used to calculate a wide variety of interesting physical
phenomena such as photon rings and reverberation lags. I will also discuss how
the simulations can be used with observational data to understand more about
the accreting systems, the properties of the central singularity, and enable us
to create impressions of accreting black holes.
